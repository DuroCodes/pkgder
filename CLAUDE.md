# Project Goals
- It should be a tinder for development packages.
- IE: You can swipe left/right on NPM packages to like/dislike them.
  - There should be support for other package managers in the future, but for now, we will focus on NPM.
- And it should save your 'saved' packages in your local storage. (no authentication required)
- The UI should use monospace fonts, dark mode, and clean design
  - Prefer shadcn/ui for the UI components.
